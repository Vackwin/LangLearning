Overall, p accounts for 1.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 36.5% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 52.5% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 4.1% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 2.2% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (35,38.0,35)
